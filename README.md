# README generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to make a README.md file with ease from the command line. The user responds to a series of prompts and the answers to the prompts will be displayed in a professional README file. This application takes the stress off of the user since all the formatting will be done automatcally.

## Installations
The user will have to install Node JS to their computer in order to perform the commands. After installing Node - you will need to run "npm init" followed by "npm install inquirer" in the command line. Now you are prepared to use the README generator.
